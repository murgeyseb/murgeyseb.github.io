My name is SÃ©bastien Murgey, I live in Paris area and I am a developer/engineer in electrical power system field.

I have been working for almost ten years as a developer, first on computation cores for power systems analysis, and since a few years now on larger scale business applications.

I have also been involved recently in the movement towards open source development in the power system development world. I am a committer of [PowSyBl project][powsybl-website], and member of PowSyBl Technical Steering Committee. I am also tech lead and committer of [FARAO project][farao-website], a toolbox for coordinated security assessment studies on electrical power systems.
