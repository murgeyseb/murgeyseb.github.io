Hi everyone!

My name is Sébastien Murgey, I live in Paris area and I am a developer/engineer in electrical power system field.
I have been working for almost ten years as a developer, first on computation cores for power systems analysis, and since a few years now on larger scale business applications.
I have also been involved recently in the movement towards open source development in the power system development world. I am a committer of [PowSyBl project][powsybl-website], and member of PowSyBl Technical Steering Committee. I am also tech lead and committer of [FARAO project][farao-website], a toolbox for coordinated security assessment studies on electrical power systems.

Like everybody else during this special period of sanitary containment, I was searching for a thing to do to clear my mind. I started writing notes about some ideas of personal projects, that could help me learning new things, and discovering new lands of application development. 

But I soon realized that part of these ideas could be turned into something better. I learnt a long time ago that the biggest quality of a developer (and an engineer) is the ability to search for information, and hopefully find it. How many blogs, or developers’ portfolios did I discover during those ten years! I finally decided that time had come to start mine. For others but also for me. To share my passion about solving problems by writing pieces of code. To take the time to capitalize on every finding I make, on every lesson I learn, on every problem I solve.

I hope this will last, and I look forward to seeing what this website will look like in one year.

In next article, I will present the first project I will work on. As a great fan of [Final Fantasy games][final-fantasy-wikipedia], I will call it "Project Ramuh".

But that’s another story…

See you soon

Sébastien
